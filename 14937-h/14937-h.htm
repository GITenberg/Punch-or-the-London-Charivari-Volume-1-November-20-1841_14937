<h2>MYSELF, PUNCH, AND THE KEELEYS.</h2>
<p>I dined with my old friend and schoolfellow, Jack Withers, one
day last September. On the previous morning, on my way to the India
House, I had run up against a stout individual on Cornhill, and on
looking in his face as I stopped for a moment to apologise, an
abrupt &ldquo;This is surely Jack Withers,&rdquo; burst from my
lips, followed by&mdash;&ldquo;God bless me! Will Bayfield!&rdquo;
from his. After a hurried question or two, we shook hands warmly
and parted, with the understanding that I was to cut my mutton with
him next day.</p>
<p>Seventeen years had elapsed since Withers and I had seen or
heard of each other. Having a good mercantile connexion, he had
pitched upon commerce as his calling, and entered a counting-house
in Idollane in the same year that I, a raw young surgeon, embarked
for India to seek my fortune in the medical service of the East
India Company.</p>
<p>Things had gone well with honest Jack; from a long, thin, weazel
of a youngster, he had become a burly ruddy-faced gentleman, with
an aldermanic rotundity of paunch, which gave the world assurance
that his ordinary fare by no means consisted of deaf nuts; he had
already, as he told me, accumulated a very pretty independence,
which was yearly increasing, and was, moreover, a snug bachelor,
with a well-arranged residence in Finsbury-square; in short, it was
evident that Jack was &ldquo;a fellow with two coats and everything
handsome about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for me, I was a verification of the adage about the rolling
stone; having gathered a very small quantity of &ldquo;moss,&rdquo;
in the shape of worldly goods. I had spent sixteen years in
marching and countermarching over the thirsty plains of the
Carnatic, in medical charge of a native regiment&mdash;salivating
Sepoys and blowing out with blue pills the officers&mdash;until the
effects of a stiff jungle-fever, that nearly made me proprietor of
a landed property measuring six feet by two, sent me back to
England almost as poor as I had left it, and with an atrabilarious
visage which took a two-months&rsquo; course of Cheltenham water to
scour into anything like a decent colour.</p>
<p>Withers&rsquo; dinner was in the best taste: viands
excellent&mdash;wine superb; never did I sip racier Madeira, and
the Champagne trickled down one&rsquo;s throat with the same
facility that man is inclined to sin.</p>
<p>The cloth drawn, we fell to discoursing about old times, things,
persons, and places. Jack then told me how from junior clerk he had
risen to become second partner in the firm to which he belonged;
and I, in my turn, enlightened his mind with respect to Asiatic
Cholera, Runjeet Sing, Ghuzni, tiger-shooting, and Shah Soojah.</p>
<p>In this manner the evening slid pleasantly on. An array of six
bottles, that before dinner had contained the juice of Oporto,
stood empty on the sideboard. Jack wanted to draw another cork,
which, however, I positively forbad, as I have through life made it
a rule to avoid the slightest approach towards excess in tippling;
so, after a modest brace of glasses of brandy-and-water, I shook
hands with and left my friend about half-past nine, for I am an
old-fashioned fellow, and love early hours, my usual time for
turning in being ten.</p>
<p>When I got into the street an unaccustomed spirit of gaiety at
once took possession of me; my general feelings of benevolence and
goodwill towards all mankind appeared to have received a sudden and
marvellous increase. I seemed to tread on eider-down, and, cigar in
mouth, strolled along Fleet-street and the Strand, towards my
domicile in Half-Moon street&mdash;&ldquo;nescio quid meditans
nugarum&rdquo;&mdash;sometimes humming the fag end of an Irish
melody; anon stopping to stare in a print-shop window; and then I
would trudge on, chewing the cud of sweet and bitter fancy as I
conned over the various ups and downs that had chequered my life
since Jack Withers and I were thoughtless lads together &ldquo;a
long time ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this mood I found myself standing before the New Strand
Theatre, my attention having been arrested by the word PUNCH
blazoned in large letters on a play-bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can this mean?&rdquo; quoth I to myself. &ldquo;I
know a publication called Punch very well, but I never heard of a
performance so named. I&rsquo;ll go in and see it. Who knows but it
may be an avatar<sup>1</sup><span class="sidenote">1. The Avatar we
do not allow&mdash;the illustrious periodical we do.&mdash;ED. OF
PUNCH.</span> of the Editor of that illustrious periodical, who
condescends to discard his dread incognito for the nonce, in order
to exhibit himself, for one night only, to the eyes and
understandings of admiring London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another minute I was seated in the boxes, and found a crowded
audience in full enjoyment of the quiet waggery of Keeley, who was
fooling them to the top of their bent, accoutred from top to toe as
Mynheer Punch the Great, while his clever little wife&mdash;who, by
the way, possesses, I think, more of the &ldquo;vis comica&rdquo;
than any actress of the day&mdash;caused sides to shake and eyes to
water by her na&iuml;ve and humorous delineation of Mrs.
Snozzle.</p>
<p>The curtain had hardly fallen more than a couple of minutes,
when a door behind me opened hastily, and a box-keeper thrusting in
his head, called out&mdash;&ldquo;Is there a medical man
here?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am one,&rdquo; said I, getting up;
&ldquo;anything the matter?&rdquo; &ldquo;Come with me then, sir,
if you please,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;a severe accident has just
happened to Mrs. Keeley; a falling scene has struck her head, sir,
and hurt her dreadfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; said I, much shocked; &ldquo;I will
come immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I followed the man to the stage door, and was ushered into a
dressing-room with several people in it, where, extended on a sofa,
lay the unfortunate lady, whom I had but a few minutes before seen
full of life and spirits, delighting hundreds with her unrivalled
humour and <em>espi&egrave;glerie</em>,&mdash;there she lay, in the
same fantastic dress she had worn on the stage, pale as
death&mdash;a quantity of blood flowing from a fearful wound on her
head, and uttering those low quick moans which are indicative of
extreme suffering.</p>
<p>Poor little Keeley stood beside the couch, holding her hand; he
was still in full fig as <em>Polichinel</em>; and the grotesqueness
of his attire contrasted strangely with the anguish depicted on his
countenance. As I came forward, he slowly made way for
me&mdash;looked in my face imploringly, as if to gather from its
expression some gleam of hope, and then stood aside, in an attitude
of profound dejection.</p>
<p>Having felt the sufferer&rsquo;s pulse, I was about to turn her
head gently, in order to examine the nature of the wound, when a
hustling noise behind me causing me to turn round, to my infinite
dismay, I perceived Mr. Keeley, having pushed the bystanders on one
side, in the act of performing a kind of Punchean dance upon the
floor, accompanying himself with the vigorous chuckling and crowing
peculiar to the hero whose habiliments he wore. I was
horror-stricken&mdash;conceiving that grief had suddenly turned his
brain.</p>
<p>All at once, he made a spring towards me, and, seizing my arm,
thrust me into a corner of the room, where he held me fast,
exclaiming&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wretch! villain! restore me my wife&mdash;that talented
woman your infernal arts have destroyed! You did for
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Keeley,&rdquo; said I, struggling to release myself
from his grasp&mdash;&ldquo;my dear sir, pray compose
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unhappy traitor!&rdquo; he shouted, giving me an
unmerciful tweak by the nose; &ldquo;Look at her silver skin laced
with her golden blood!&mdash;see, see! Oh, see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was rather too much, even from a man whose wits were
astray. I began to lose patience, and was preparing to rid myself
somewhat roughly of the madman&rsquo;s grasp, when a new phenomenon
occurred.</p>
<p>The patient on the sofa, whom I had judged well nigh moribund,
and consequently incapable of any effort whatever, all at once sat
up with a sudden jerk, and gave vent to a series of the most
ear-piercing shrieks that ever assailed human tympanum.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Oh! oh! Mon Dieu! je suis &eacute;touff&eacute;e!
levez-vous donc, monsieur&mdash;n&rsquo;avez-vous pas
honte!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>I started up&mdash;O misery!&mdash;I had fallen asleep, and my
head, resting against a pillar, had slipped down, depositing itself
upon the expansive bosom of a portly French dame in the next box,
who seemed, by her vehement exclamations, to be quite shaken from
the balance of her propriety by the unlooked-for burthen I had
imposed upon her; whilst a <em>petit monsieur</em> poured forth a
string of <em>sacres</em> and <em>sapristies</em> upon my devoted
head with a volubility of utterance truly astonishing.</p>
<p>I gazed about me with troubled and lack-lustre eye. Every
lorgnette in the boxes was levelled at my miserable countenance; a
sea of upturned and derisive faces grinned at me from the pit, and
the gods in Olympus thundered from on high&mdash;&ldquo;Turn him
out; he&rsquo;s drunk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the unkindest cut of all&mdash;thus publicly to be
accused of intoxication, a vice of all others I have ever detested
and eschewed.</p>
<p>I cast one indignant glance around me, and left the theatre,
lamenting the depravity of our nature, which is, alas! always ready
to put the worst construction upon actions in themselves most
innocent; for if I had gone to sleep in my own arm-chair, pray who
would have accused me of inebriety?</p>
<p>How I got home I know not. As I hurried through the streets, a
legion of voices, in every variety of intonation, yelled in my
ears&mdash;&ldquo;Turn him out&mdash;he&rsquo;s drunk!&rdquo; and
when I woke in the middle of the night, tormented by a raging
thirst (produced, I suppose, by the flurry of spirits I had
undergone), I seemed to hear screams, groans, and hisses, above all
which predominated loud and clear the malignant
denunciation&mdash;&ldquo;Turn him out&mdash;he&rsquo;s
drunk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon my subsequently mentioning the above adventure to Jack
Withers, it will hardly be credited that this villain without shame
at once roundly asserted that, when I left him on the
afore-mentioned night, I was at least three sheets and three
quarters in the wind; adding with praiseworthy candour, that he
himself was so far gone as to be obliged, to the infinite scandal
of his staid old housekeeper, to creep up stairs <em>&agrave;
quatre pieds</em>, in order to gain his bedroom.</p>
<p>Now this latter may be true enough, for it is probable that
friend Jack <span class="pagenum"><a id="page218" name=
"page218"></a>[pg 218]</span>freshened his nip a trifle after my
departure, seeing that he was always something of a drunken knave.
As for his calumnious and scandalous declaration, that <em>I</em>
was in the least degree tipsy, it is too ridiculous to be noticed.
I scorn it with my heels&mdash;I was sober&mdash;sober, cool, and
steady as the north star; and he that is inclined to question this
solemn asseveration, let him send me his card; and if I don&rsquo;t
drill a hole in his doublet before he&rsquo;s forty-eight hours
older, then, as honest Slender has it, &ldquo;I would I might never
come in mine own great chamber again else.&rdquo;</p>
<hr />
<h3>&ldquo;ARE YE SURE THE NEWS IS TRUE?&rdquo;</h3>
<p>We learn from good authority that Lord TAMBOFF STANLEY, in
answer to a deputation from Scotland, assured the gentlemen who
waited upon him that &ldquo;the subject of <em>emigration</em> was
under the serious consideration of Her Majesty&rsquo;s
Ministers.&rdquo; We hope that those respectable gentlemen may soon
resolve upon their departure&mdash;we care not &ldquo;what clime
they wander to, so not again to <em>this</em>;&rdquo; or, as
Shakspeare says, let them &ldquo;stand not upon the order of their
going, but GO.&rdquo; The country, we take it upon ourselves to
say, will remember them when they are gone; they have left the
nation too many weighty proofs of their regard to be forgotten in a
hurry&mdash;Corruption, Starvation, and Taxation, and the National
Debt by way of</p>

<p>Peter Borthwick, late of the Royal Surrey Nautical, having had
the honour of &ldquo;deep damnation&rdquo; conferred upon his
&ldquo;taking off&rdquo; the character of Prince Henry, upon that
occasion, to appear in unison with the text of the Immortal Bard,
&ldquo;dressed&rdquo; the part in a most elaborate
&ldquo;neck-or-nothing tile.&rdquo; Upon being expostulated with by
the manager, he triumphantly referred to the description of the
chivalrous Prince in which the narrator particularly
states&mdash;</p>

<h3>CUTTING AT THE ROOT OF THE EVIL.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, Sir Peter,&rdquo; said Hobler,
confidentially, to our dearly beloved Alderman, &ldquo;How could
you have passed such a ridiculous sentence upon Jones, as to direct
his hair to be cut off?&rdquo; &ldquo;All right, my dear
Hobby,&rdquo; replied the sapient justice; &ldquo;the fellow was
found fighting in the streets, and I wanted to hinder him, at least
for some time, from again</p>

<h3>TO PUNCH.</h3>
<p>We have received the following choice bit of poetic pathology
from our old friend and jolly dog Toby, who, it seems, has taken to
medicine. The dog, however, always had a great propensity to
<em>bark</em>, owing doubtlessly to the strong <em>tincture</em> of
<em>canine</em> there was in his constitution:&mdash;</p>
<p>MY DEAR PUNCH,</p>
<p>Nothing convinces me more of my treacherous memory than my not
recollecting you at the memorable &ldquo;New-boot Supper;&rdquo;
for I certainly must have been as long in that society as yourself.
Be that as it may, you have induced me to scrape together a few
reminiscences in an imperfect way, leaving to you, from your better
recollection, to correct and flavour the specimen to the palate of
your readers, who have, most deservedly, every reliance upon your
good taste and moral tendency. I have in vain tried to meet with
the music of &ldquo;the good old days of Adam and Eve,&rdquo;
consequently have lost the enjoyment of the
chorus&mdash;&ldquo;Sing hey, sing ho!&rdquo; It would be too much
to ask you to sing it, but perhaps you may too-te-too it in your
next. May your good intentions to the would-be &AElig;sculapius be
attended with success.&mdash;I remain, dear Punch, your old
friend,</p>

<h2>THE HEIR OF APPLEBITE.</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>
<h4>WHEREIN THE READER WILL FIND GREAT CAUSE FOR REJOICING.</h4>

"A letter C with flowers trailing from it and an heron in its bowl."
id="img019-05" name="img019-05" width="100%" /></a></div>
<p><span class="hide">C</span>onducive as Uncle Peter&rsquo;s
suggestion might have been to the restoration of peace in the
family of our hero, it was decided to be impracticable by several
medical gentlemen, who were consulted upon the matter. After sundry
scenes of maternal and grandmaternal distress, Agamemnon succeeded
in obtaining the victory, and the heir was vaccinated accordingly
with the most favourable result. The pustule rose, budded,
blossomed, and disappeared, exactly as it ought to have done, and a
few days saw the health of the infant Applebite insured in the
office of Dr. Jenner.</p>
<p>Scarcely had the anxious parents been relieved by this
auspicious termination, when that painful disorder which renders
pork unwholesome and children fractious, made its appearance. Had
we the plague-pen of the romancist of Rookwood, we would revel in
the detail of this domesticated pestilence&mdash;we would picture
the little sufferer in the hour of its agony&mdash;and be as minute
as Mr. Hume in our calculations of its feverish pulsations; but our
quill was moulted by the dove, not plucked from the wing of the
carrion raven.</p>
<p>And now, gentle reader, we come to a point of this history which
we are assured has been anxiously looked forward to by you&mdash;a
point at which the reader, already breathless with expectation, has
fondly anticipated being suffocated with excitement. We may,
without vanity, lay claim to originality, for we have introduced a
new hero into the world of fiction&mdash;a baby three months
old&mdash;we have traced his happy parents from the ball-room to
St. George&rsquo;s church; from St. George&rsquo;s church to the
ball-room; thence to the doctor&rsquo;s; and from thence to</p>
<h3>THE END.</h3>
<p>Reproach us not, mamas?&mdash;Discard us not, ye blushing
divinities who have, with your sex&rsquo;s softness, dandled the
heir of Applebite in your imaginations!&mdash;Wait!&mdash;Wait till
we have explained! We have a motive; but as we are novices in this
style of literature, we will avail ourselves, at our leave-taking,
of the valedictory address of one who is more &ldquo;up to the
swindle.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="cen"><em>To the Readers of the Heir of
Applebite</em>.</p>
<p>DEAR FRIENDS,&mdash;Having finished the infanto-biography upon
which we have been engaged, it is our design to cut off our heir,
and bring our tale to a close. You may want to know why&mdash;or if
you don&rsquo;t, we will tell you.</p>
<p>We should not regard the anxiety, the close confinement, or the
constant attention inseparable from a nursery, did we feel that the
result was agreeable to you. But we have not done so. We have been
strongly tempted to think, that after waiting from week to week,
you have never arrived at anything interesting. We could not bear
this jerking of our conscience, which was no sooner ended than
begun again.</p>
<p>Most &ldquo;passages in a tale of <em>any length</em> depend
materially for the interest on the intimate relation they bear to
what has gone before, or what is to follow.&rdquo; We sometimes
found it difficult to accomplish this.</p>
<p>Considerations of immediate profit ought, in such cases, to be
of secondary importance; but, for the reasons we have just
mentioned, we have (after some pains to resist the temptation)
determined to abandon this <em>scheme</em> of publication.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the respite which the close of this work
will afford us, we have decided in January next to rent a second
floor at Kentish Town.</p>
<p>The pleasure we anticipate from the realisation of a wish we
have long entertained and long hoped to gratify, is subdued by the
reflection that we shall find it somewhat difficult to emancipate
our moveables from the thraldom of Mrs. Gibbons, our respected but
over-particular landlady.</p>
<p>To console the numerous readers of PUNCH, we have it in command
to announce, that on Saturday, Nov. 27th, the first chapter of a
series under the title of the &ldquo;Puff Papers,&rdquo;
appropriately illustrated, will be commenced, with a desire to
supply the hiatus in periodical fiction, occasioned by the
temporary seclusion of one of the most popular novelists of the
day.</p>

<h3>THE LAMBETH DEMOSTHENES.</h3>
<p>We are happy to find that Dr. Tully Cicero Burke Sheridan
Grattan Charles Phillips Hobler Bedford has not been deterred by
the late unsatisfactory termination to the &ldquo;public
meeting&rdquo; called by him to address the Queen, from prosecuting
his patriotic views for his own personal advantage. Dr. &amp;c.
Bedford has kindly furnished us with the report of a meeting called
by himself, which consisted of himself, for the purpose of
considering the propriety of petitioning the Throne to appoint
himself to be medical-adviser-in-general to her Majesty, and
vaccinator-in-particular to his little Highness the Prince of
Wales.</p>
<p>At 10 o&rsquo;clock precisely Dr. &amp;c. Bedford entered the
little back parlour of his surgery, and advancing to the
looking-glass over the mantel-piece, made a polite bow to the
reflection of himself. After a few complimentary gestures had
passed between them, Dr &amp;c. Bedford hemmed twice, and in a very
elegant speech proposed that &ldquo;Doctor &amp;c. Bedford
<em>shoold</em> take the <em>cheer</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. &amp;c. Bedford rose to second the proposition. Dr. &amp;c.
Bedford said, &ldquo;Dr. &amp;c. Bedford is a gentleman what I have
had the honour of knowing on for many long ears. His medikel
requirement are sich as ris a Narvey and a Nunter to the summut of
the temples of Fame. His political requisitions are summarily
extinguished. It is, therefore, with no common pride that I second
this abomination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. &amp;c. Bedford then bowed to his reflection in the glass,
and proceeded to take his seat in his easy chair, thumping the
table with one hand, and placing the other gracefully upon his
breast, as though in token of gratitude for the honour conferred
upon him.</p>
<p>Order being restored, Dr. &amp;c. Bedford rose and
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never kotched myself in sich a sitchuation in my
life&mdash;I mean not that I hasn&rsquo;t taken a cheer afore,
perhaps carried one&mdash;but it never has been my proud extinction
to preside over such a meeting&mdash;so numerous in its numbers and
suspectable in its appearance. My friend, Dr. &amp;c. Bedford,
(<em>Hear, hear! from. Dr. &amp;c. Bedford</em>,) his the hornament
of natur in this 19th cemetary. His prodigious
outlays&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><em>Voice without</em>.&mdash;&ldquo;Here they are, only a
penny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. &amp;c. Bedford.&mdash;&ldquo;Order, order!
His&mdash;his&mdash;you know what I mean that shoold distinguish
the fisishun and the orator. I may say the Solus of
orators,&mdash;renders him the most fittest and the most properest
person to take care of the Royal health, and the Royal Infant Babby
of these regions,&rdquo; (<em>Hear, hear! from Dr. &amp;c.
Bedford</em>.)</p>
<p>The Doctor then proceeded to embody the foregoing observations
into a resolution, which was proposed by Dr. &amp;c. Bedford, and
seconded by Dr. &amp;c. Bedford, who having held up both his hands,
declared it to be carried <em>nem. con.</em></p>
<p>Dr. &amp;c. Bedford then proposed a vote of thanks to Dr,
&amp;c. Bedford for his conduct in the chair. The meeting then
dispersed, after Dr. &amp;c. Bedford had returned thanks, and bowed
to his own reflection in the looking-glass.</p>

<h2>A LEGEND OF THE TOWER (NOT LONDON).</h2>
<p>In the immediate vicinity of the pretty little town of Kells
stands one of those peculiar high round towers, the origin of which
has so long puzzled the brains of antiquaries. It is invariably
pointed out to the curious, as a fit subject for their
contemplation, and may, in fact, be looked upon as the great local
lion of the place. It appears almost inaccessible. But there is a
story extant, and told in very choice Irish, how two small
dare-devil urchins did succeed in reaching its lofty summit; and
this is the way the legend was done into English by one Barney
Riley, the narrator, to whom I am indebted for its
knowledge:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see Masther Robert, sir,&mdash;though its murduring
high, and almost entirely quite aqual in stapeness to the ould
ancient Tower of Babel, yet, sir, there is them living now as have
been at the top of that same; be the same token I knew both
o&rsquo; the spalpeens myself. It&rsquo;s grown up they are now;
but whin they wint daws&rsquo;-nesting to the top there, the little
blackguards weren&rsquo;t above knee-high, if so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did they arrive at the summit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the wonder of it! but sure nobody knows but
themselves; but the scamps managed somehow or other to insart
themselves in through one of them small loopholes&mdash;whin little
Danny Carroll gave Tom Sheeney a leg up and a back, and Tom Sheeney
hauled little Danny up after him by the scruff o&rsquo; the neck;
and so they wint squeedging and scrummaging on till, by dad, they
was up at the tip-top in something less than no time; and the
trouble was all they had a chance o&rsquo; gettin for their pains;
for, by the hokey, the daws&rsquo; nest they had been bruising
their shins, breaking their necks, and tearing their frieze
breeches to tatters to reach, was on the outside o&rsquo; the
building, and about as hard to get at as truth, or marcy from a
thafe of a tythe proctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hubbabboo,&rsquo; says little Danny; &lsquo;we are
on the wrong side now, as Pat Murphy&rsquo;s carroty wig was whin
it came through his hat; what will we do, at all, at
all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Divil a know I know. It would make a parson swear
after takin&rsquo; tythe. Do you hear the vagabones? Oh, then
musha, bad luck to your cawings; its impedence, and nothing but it,
to be shouting out in defiance of us, you dirty bastes. Danny, lad,
you&rsquo;re but a little thrifle of a gossoon; couldn&rsquo;t you
squeedge yourself through one o&rsquo; them holes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What will I stand&mdash;or, for the matter
o&rsquo; that, as I&rsquo;m by no manes particular,&mdash;sit upon,
whin I git out&mdash;that is, if I can?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look here, lad, hear a dacent word&mdash;it will
be just the dandy thing for yes entirely; go to it with a will, and
make yourself as small as a little cock elven, and thin we&rsquo;ll
have our revenge upon them aggravation thaves.&rsquo; How the puck
he done it nobody knows; but by dad there was his little, ragged,
red poll, followed by the whole of his small body, seen coming out
o&rsquo; that trap-loop there, that doesn&rsquo;t look much bigger
than a button-hole&mdash;and thin sitting astride the ould bit of
rotten timbers, and laffing like mad, was the tiny Masther Danny,
robbing the nests, and shouting with joy as he pulled bird after
bird from their nate little feather-beds. &lsquo;This is
elegant,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;here&rsquo;s lashins of
&rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How many have you,&rsquo; says Tom Sheeney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Seven big uns&mdash;full fledged, wid feathers as
black as the priest&rsquo;s breeches on a Good Friday&rsquo;s
fast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Seven is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, then, hand them in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By no manes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Seein they&rsquo;re as well wid me as you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Give me my half then&mdash;that&rsquo;s
your&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Aisy wid you; who&rsquo;s had the trouble and the
chance of breaking his good-looking neck but me, Mr. Tim
Sheeney.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Devil a care I care; I&rsquo;ll have four, or
I&rsquo;ll know why.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That you&rsquo;ll soon do: I won&rsquo;t give
&rsquo;em you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Aint I holding the wood?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By coorse you are; but aint I sitting outside upon
it, and by the same token unseating my best breeches.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I bid you take care; give me four.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ha, ha! what a buck your granny was, Mistet Tim
Sheeney; it&rsquo;s three you&rsquo;ll have, or none.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then by the puck I&rsquo;ll let you go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I defy you to do it, you murdering
robber.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you! by dad; once more, give me
four.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To blazes wid you; three or none.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then there you go!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, worse luck, sure enough he did, and that at the
devil&rsquo;s own pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this moment I turned my eyes in horror to the Tower,
and the height was awful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor child,&mdash;of course he was killed upon the
spot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the wonder; not a ha&rsquo;porth o&rsquo;
harm did the vagabone take at all at all. He held on by the
birds&rsquo; legs like a little nagur; he was but a shimpeen of a
chap, and what with the flapping of their wings and the soft place
he fell upon, barring a little thrifle of stunning, and it may be a
small matter of fright, he was as comfortable as any one could
expect under the circumstances; but it would have done your heart
good to see the little gossoon jump up, shake his feathers, and
shout out at the top of his small voice, &lsquo;Tim Sheeney, you
thief, you&rsquo;d better have taken the three,&mdash;for d&mdash;n
the daw do you get now!&rsquo;&rdquo; And so ends the Legend of the
Round Tower.</p>

<h3>IRISH INTELLIGENCE.</h3>
<h4>AWFUL STATE OF THE COUNTRY!</h4>
<p class="cen">(<em>From our own Correspondent.</em>)</p>
<p>We are at length enabled to inform the Public that we have, at a
vast expense, completed our arrangements for the transmission of
the earliest news from Ireland. We have just received the
<em>Over-bog Mail</em>, which contains facts of a most interesting
nature. We hasten to lay our sagacious correspondent&rsquo;s
remarks before our readers:&mdash;</p>
<p class="rgt"><em>Bally-ha-ghadera, Tuesday Night</em>.</p>
<p>PUNCH will appreciate my unwillingness to furnish him with
intelligence which might in any way disturb the commercial
relations between this and the sister island, more particularly at
the <em>present crisis</em>, when the interests of that prosperous
class, the London Baked Potatoe vendors, are so intimately
connected, with the preservation of good feeling among the
Tipperary growers. However, my duty to PUNCH and the public compel
me to speak.&mdash;I do feel that we are on the eve of a great
popular commotion. Every day&rsquo;s occurrences strengthen my
conviction. Bally-ha-ghadera was this morning at sunrise disturbed
by noises of the most appalling kind, forming a wild chorus, in
which screams and bellowings seemed to vie for supremacy; indeed
words cannot adequately describe this terrific disturbance. As I
expected, the depraved Whig Journalist, with characteristic mental
tortuosity, has asserted that the sounds proceeded from a rookery
in the adjoining wood, aided by the braying of the turf-man&rsquo;s
donkey. But an enlightened public will see through this paltry
subterfuge. Rooks and donkeys! Pooh! There cannot be a doubt but
that the noises were the preparatory war-whoops of this ferocious
and sanguinary people. We believe the Whig editor to be the only
<em>donkey</em> in the case; that he may have been a ravin(g) at
the time is also very probable.</p>
<p>No later than yesterday the <em>Cloonakilty Express</em> was
stopped by a <em>band of young men</em>, who savagely ill-treated
our courier, a youth of tender age, having attempted to stone him
to death. Our courier is ready to swear that at the time of the
attack the young men were busily engaged counting a <em>vast store
of ammunition</em>, consisting of <em>round white clay balls</em>
baked to the hardness of bullets, and <em>evidently</em> intended
for <em>shooting with</em>.</p>
<p>I have to call particular attention to the fact that a
countryman was this day observed to buy a threepenny loaf, and on
leaving the baker&rsquo;s to <em>tear it asunder and distribute the
fragments with three confederates</em>!!! an act which I need not
say was evidently symbolical of their desire to rend asunder the
<em>Corn Laws</em>, and to divide the landed property amongst
themselves. The action also appears analogous to the custom of
breaking bread and swearing alliance on it, a practice still
observed by the inhabitants of some remote regions of the Caucasus.
I must again solemnly express my conviction that we are standing on
a <em>slumbering</em> VOLCANO; the thoughtless and unobservant may
suppose not; probably because in the present tee-total state of
society they see nothing of the CRATER.</p>

<h3>TAKING A SIGHT AT THE FIRE.</h3>
<p>A man bearing the very inapplicable name of <em>Virtue</em> was
brought up at Lambeth-street last week, on the charge of having
stolen a telescope from the Ordnance-office in the Tower on the
morning of the fire. The prisoner pleaded that, being
short-sighted, he took the glass to have a sight of the fire. The
magistrate, however, <em>saw through</em> this excuse very clearly;
and as it was apparent that <em>Virtue</em> had taken a
<em>glass</em> too much on the occasion, he was fully
committed.</p>

<h3>JOE HUME&rsquo;S FORTHCOMING WORK.</h3>
<p>We have received the following note from an old and esteemed
correspondent, who, we are rejoiced to find, has returned from a
tour in Switzerland, where he has been engaged in a prodigious work
connected with the statistics of that country.</p>
<p class="rgt"><em>Reform Club-house</em>.</p>
<p>DEAR PUNCH,</p>
<p>Knowing the interest you take in anything relating to the
advancement of science, I beg to apprise you that I am about
publishing a statistical work, in which I have made it perfectly
clear that an immense saving in the article of ice alone might be
made in England by importing that which lies waste upon Mont Blanc.
I have also calculated to a fraction the number of pints of milk
produced in the canton of Berne, distinguishing the quantity used
in the making of cheese from that which has been consumed in the
manufacture of butter&mdash;and specifying in every instance
whether the milk has been yielded by cows or goats. There will be
also a valuable appendix to the work, containing a correct list of
all the inns on the road between Frankfort and Geneva, with a copy
of the bill of fare at each, and the prices charged; together with
the colour of the postilion&rsquo;s jacket, the age of the landlord
and the weight of his wife, and the height in inches of the cook
and chambermaid. To which will be added, &ldquo;Ten Minutes&rsquo;
Advice&rdquo; upon making one shilling go as far as two. If you can
give me a three-halfpenny puff in your admired publication, you
will confer a favour on</p>
<p class="rgt">Your sincere friend,<br />

<h2>THE ROMANCE OF A TEACUP.</h2>
<h3>SIP THE FIRST.</h3>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>In England one man&rsquo;s mated to one woman,</p>
<p class="i2">To spend their days in holy matrimony&mdash;</p>
<p>In fact, I <em>have</em> heard from one or two men,</p>
<p class="i2">That one wife in a house is one too many&mdash;</p>
<p>But, be this as it may, in China no man</p>
<p class="i2">Who can afford it shuts himself to any</p>
<p>Fix&rsquo;d number, but is variously encumber&rsquo;d</p>
<p>With better halves, from twenty to a hundred.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>These to provide for in a pleasant way,</p>
<p class="i2">And, maybe, to avoid their chat and worry,</p>
<p>He shuts up in a harem night and day&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">With them contriving all his cares to bury&mdash;</p>
<p>A point of policy which, I should say,</p>
<p class="i2">Sweetens the dose to men about to marry;</p>
<p>For, though a wife&rsquo;s a charming thing enough,</p>
<p>Yet, like all other blessings, <em>quantum suff</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>So to my tale: Te-pott the Multifarious</p>
<p class="i2">Was, once upon a time, a mandarin&mdash;</p>
<p>In personal appearance but precarious,</p>
<p class="i2">Being incorrigibly bald and thin&mdash;</p>
<p>But then so rich, through jobs and pensions various,</p>
<p class="i2">Obtain&rsquo;d by voting with the party
&ldquo;in,&rdquo;</p>
<p>That he maintain&rsquo;d, in grace and honour too,</p>
<p>Sixty-five years, and spouses fifty-two.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Fifty-two wives! and still he went about</p>
<p class="i2">Peering below the maiden ladies&rsquo;
veils&mdash;</p>
<p>Indeed, it <em>was</em> said (but there hangs a doubt</p>
<p class="i2">Of scandal on such gossip-whisper&rsquo;d tales),</p>
<p>He had a good one still to single out&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">For all his wives had tongues, and <em>some</em> had
nails&mdash;</p>
<p>And still he hoped, though fifty-twice deferr&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>To find an angel in his fifty-third.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>In China, mind, and such outlandish places,</p>
<p class="i2">A gentleman who wishes to be wed</p>
<p>Looks round about among the pretty faces,</p>
<p class="i2">Nor for a moment doubts they may be had</p>
<p>For asking; and if any of them &ldquo;nay&rdquo; says,</p>
<p class="i2">He has his remedy as soon as said&mdash;</p>
<p>For, when the bridegrooms disapprove what they do,</p>
<p>They teach them manners with the bastinado.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Near Te-pott&rsquo;s palace lived an old Chinese&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">About as poor a man as could be known</p>
<p>In lands where guardians leave them to their ease,</p>
<p class="i2">Nor pen the poor up in bastilles of stone:</p>
<p>He got a livelihood by picking teas;</p>
<p class="i2">And of possessions worldly had but one&mdash;</p>
<p>But one&mdash;the which, the reader must be told,</p>
<p>Was a fair daughter seventeen years old.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>She was a lovely little girl, and one</p>
<p class="i2">To charm the wits of both the high and <em>the</em>
low;</p>
<p>And Te-pott&rsquo;s ancient heart was lost and won</p>
<p class="i2">In less time than &rsquo;twould take my pen to tell
how:</p>
<p>So, as he was quite an experienced son-</p>
<p class="i2">In-law, and, too, a very wily fellow,</p>
<p>To make Hy-son his friend was no hard matter, I</p>
<p>Ween, with that specific for parents&mdash;flattery.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>But, when they two had settled all between</p>
<p class="i2">Themselves, and Te-pott thought that he had caught
her,</p>
<p>He found how premature his hopes had been</p>
<p class="i2">Without the approbation of the daughter&mdash;</p>
<p>Who talk&rsquo;d with voice so loud and wit so keen,</p>
<p class="i2">That he thought all his Mrs. T&rsquo;s had taught
her;</p>
<p>And, finding he was in the way there rather,</p>
<p>He left her to be lectured by her father.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Pray, what were women made for&rdquo; (so she said,</p>
<p class="i2">Though Heaven forbid I join such tender saying),</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they to be accounted are as dead,</p>
<p class="i2">And strangled if they ever are caught straying?</p>
<p>Tis well to give us diamonds for the head,</p>
<p class="i2">And silken gauds for festival arraying;</p>
<p>But where of dress or diamonds is the use</p>
<p>If we mayn&rsquo;t go and show them? that&rsquo;s the
deuce!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>The father answer&rsquo;d, much as fathers do</p>
<p class="i2">In cases of like nature here in Britain,</p>
<p>Where fathers seldom let fortunes slip through</p>
<p class="i2">Their fingers, when they think that they can get
one;</p>
<p>He said a many things extremely true&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Proving that girls are fine things to be quit on,</p>
<p>And that, could she accommodate her views to it,</p>
<p>She would find marriage very nice when used to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Now, &rsquo;tis no task to talk a woman into</p>
<p class="i2">Love, or a dance, or into dressing fine&mdash;</p>
<p>No task, I&rsquo;ve heard, to talk her into sin too;</p>
<p class="i2">But, somehow, reason don&rsquo;t seem in her
line.</p>
<p>And so Miss Hy-son, spite of kith and kin too,</p>
<p class="i2">Persisting such a husband to decline&mdash;</p>
<p>The eager mandarin issued a warrant,</p>
<p>And got her apprehended by her parent.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Thus the poor girl was caught, for there was no</p>
<p class="i2">Appeal against so wealthy lover&rsquo;s fiat:</p>
<p>She must e&rsquo;en be a wife of his, and so</p>
<p class="i2">She yielded him her hand demure and quiet;</p>
<p>For ladies seldom cry unless they know</p>
<p class="i2">There&rsquo;s somebody convenient to cry
<em>at</em>&mdash;</p>
<p>And; though it is consoling, on reflection</p>
<p>Such fierce emotions ruin the complexion.</p>

<h3>FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE.</h3>
<p>Yesterday Paddy Green honoured that great artist William Hogarth
Teniers Raphael Bunks, Esq., with a sitting for a likeness. The
portrait, which will doubtless be an admirable one, is stated to be
destined to adorn one of Mr. Catnach&rsquo;s ballads, namely,
&ldquo;The Monks of Old!&rdquo; which Mr. P. Green, in most
obliging manner, has allowed to appear.</p>
<p>William Paul took a walk yesterday as far as Houndsditch, in
company with Jeremiah Donovan. A pair of left-off unmentionables is
confidently reported to be the cause of their visit in the
&ldquo;far East.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady of Paddy Green, Esquire, on Wednesday last, with that
kindness which has always distinguished her, caused to be
distributed a platterful of trotter bones amongst the starving dogs
of the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>From information exclusively our own, and for whose correctness
we would stake our hump, we learn that James Burke, the honoured
member of the P.R., was seen to walk home on the night of Tuesday
last with three fresh herrings on a twig. After supper, he consoled
himself with a pint of fourpenny ale.</p>
<p>Charles Mears yesterday took a ride in a Whitechapel omnibus. He
alighted at Aldgate Pump, at which he took a draught of water from
the ladle. He afterwards regaled on a couple of polonies and a
penny loaf.</p>
<hr />
<h3>THE UNKINDEST CUT OF ALL.</h3>
<p>Jones, the journeyman tailor who was charged before Sir Peter
Laurie with being drunk and disorderly in Fleet-street, escaped the
penalty of his frolic by an extraordinary whim of justice. The
young schneider, it appears, sported a luxuriant crop of hair, the
fashion of which not pleasing the fancy of the city Rhadamanthus,
he remitted the fine on condition that the delinquent should
instantly cut off the offending hairs. A barber being sent for, the
operation was instantly performed; and Sir Peter, with a spirit of
generosity only to be equalled by his <em>cutting</em> humour,
actually put his hand in his breeches-pocket and handed over to the
official Figaro his fee of one shilling. The shorn tailor left the
office protesting that Sir Peter had not treated him handsomely, as
he had only consented to sacrifice his flowing locks, but that the
Alderman had cabbaged his whiskers as well.</p>

<h2>THE PRINCE OF WALES.&mdash;HIS FUTURE TIMES.</h2>
<p>A private letter from Hanover states that, precisely at twelve
minutes to eleven in the morning on the ninth of the present
November, his Majesty King ERNEST was suddenly attacked by a
violent fit of blue devils. All the court doctors were immediately
summoned, and as immediately dismissed, by his Majesty, who sent
for the Wizard of the North (recently appointed royal astrologer),
to divine the mysterious cause of this so sudden melancholy. In a
trice the mystery was solved&mdash;Queen Victoria &ldquo;was
happily delivered of a Prince!&rdquo; His Majesty was immediately
assisted to his chamber&mdash;put to bed&mdash;the curtains
drawn&mdash;all the royal household ordered to wear list
slippers&mdash;the one knocker to the palace was carefully tied
up&mdash;and (on the departure of our courier) half a load of straw
was already deposited beneath the window of the royal chamber. The
sentinels on duty were prohibited from even sneezing, under pain of
death, and all things in and about the palace, to use a bran new
simile, were silent as the grave!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whilst there was only the Princess Royal there were many
hopes. There was hope from severe teething&mdash;hope from
measles&mdash;hope from hooping-cough&mdash;but with the addition
of a Prince of Wales, the hopes of Hanover are below par.&rdquo;
But we pause. We will no further invade the sanctity of the sorrows
of a king; merely observing, that what makes his Majesty very
savage, makes hundreds of thousands of Englishmen mighty glad.
There are now two cradles between the Crown of England and the
White Horse of Hanover.</p>
<p>We have a Prince of Wales! Whilst, however, England is throwing
up its million caps in rapture at the advent, let it not be
forgotten to whom we owe the royal baby. In the clamourousness of
our joy the fact would have escaped us, had we not received a
letter from Colonel SIBTHORP, who assures us that we owe a Prince
of Wales entirely to the present cabinet; had the Whigs remained in
office, the infant would inevitably have been a girl.</p>
<p>For our own part&mdash;but we confess we are sometimes apt to
look too soberly at things&mdash;we think her Majesty (may all good
angels make her caudle!) is, inadvertently no doubt, treated in a
questionable spirit of compliment by these uproarious rejoicings at
the sex of the illustrious little boy, who has cast, if possible, a
new dignity upon Lord Mayor&rsquo;s day, and made the very giants
of Guildhall shoot up an inch taller at the compliment he has paid
them of visiting the world on the ninth of November. In our playful
enthusiasm, we have&mdash;that is, the public
<em>We</em>&mdash;declared we must have a Prince of Wales&mdash;we
should be dreadfully in the dumps if the child were not a
Prince&mdash;the Queen must have a Prince&mdash;a bouncing
Prince&mdash;and nothing but a Prince. Now might not an ill-natured
Philosopher (but all philosophers are ill-natured) interpret these
yearnings for masculine royalty as something like pensive regrets
that the throne should ever be filled by the feminine sex? For own
part we are perfectly satisfied that the Queen (may she live to see
the Prince of Wales wrinkled and white-headed!) is a Queen, and
think VICTORIA THE FIRST sounds quite as musically&mdash;has in it
as full a note of promise&mdash;as if the regal name had
run&mdash;GEORGE THE FIFTH! We think there is a positive want of
gallantry at this unequivocally shouted preference of a Prince of
Wales. Nevertheless, we are happy to say, the pretty, good-tempered
Princess Royal (she is <em>not</em> blind, as the Tories once
averred; but then the Whigs were <em>in</em>) still laughs and
chirrups as if nothing had happened. Nay, as a proof of the happy
nature of the infant (we beg to say that the fact is copyright, as
we purchased it of the reporter of <em>The Observer</em>), whilst,
on the ninth instant, the chimes of St. Martin&rsquo;s were
sounding merrily for the birth of the Prince, the Princess
magnanimously shook her coral-bells in welcome of her dispossessing
brother!</p>
<p>Independently of the sensation made in the City by the new glory
that has fallen upon the ninth of November (it is said that Sir
PETER LAURIE has been so rapt by the auspicious coincidence, that
he has done nothing since but talk and think of &ldquo;the Prince
of Wales&rdquo;&mdash;that on Wednesday last he rebuked an infant
beggar with, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing for you, <em>Prince of
Wales</em>&rdquo;)&mdash;independently of the lustre flung upon the
new Lord Mayor and the Lord Mayor just out&mdash;who will, it is
said, both be caudle-cup baronets, the occasion has given birth to
much deep philosophy on the part of our contemporaries&mdash;so
deep, that there is no getting to the end of it, and has also
revived much black-letter learning connected with the birth of
every Prince of Wales, from the first to the last&mdash;and,
therefore, certainly not least&mdash;new-comer.</p>
<p>An hour or so after George the Fourth was born, we are told that
the waggons containing the treasure of the <em>Hermione</em>, a
Spanish galleon, captured off St. Vincent by three English
frigates, entered St. James&rsquo;s street, escorted by cavalry and
infantry, with trumpets sounding, the enemy&rsquo;s flags waving
over the waggons, and the whole surrounded by an immense multitude
of spectators. Now here, to the vulgar mind, was a happy augury of
the future golden reign of the Royal baby. He comes upon the earth
amid a shower of gold! The melodious chink of doubloons and pieces
of eight echo his first infant wailings! What a theme for the
gipsies of the press&mdash;the fortune-tellers of the time! At the
present hour that baby sleeps the last sleep in St. George&rsquo;s
chapel; and we have his public and his social history before us.
What does experience&mdash;the experience bought and paid for by
hard, hard cash&mdash;<em>now</em> read in the &ldquo;waggons of
treasure,&rdquo; groaning musically to the rocking-cradle of the
callow infant? Simply, the babe of Queen Charlotte would be a very
expensive babe indeed; and that the wealth of a Spanish galleon was
all insufficient for the youngling&rsquo;s future wants.</p>
<p>We have been favoured, among a series of pictures, with the
following of George the Fourth, exhibited in his babyhood. We are
told that &ldquo;all persons <em>of fashion</em> were admitted to
see the Prince, under the following restrictions, viz.&mdash;that
in passing through the apartment <em>they stepped with the greatest
caution</em>, and did not offer to touch his Royal Highness. For
the greater security in this respect, a part of the apartment was
latticed off <em>in the Chinese manner</em>, to prevent curious
persons from approaching too nearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That lattice &ldquo;in the Chinese manner&rdquo; was a small yet
fatal fore-shadowing of the Chinese Pavilion at Brighton&mdash;of
that temple, worthy of Pekin, wherein the Royal infant of
threescore was wont to enshrine himself, not from the desecrating
touch of the world, but even from the eyes of a curious people,
who, having paid some millions toward manufacturing the most
finished gentleman in Europe, had now and then a wish&mdash;an
unregarded wish&mdash;to look at their expensive handiwork.</p>
<p>What different prognostics have we in the natal day of our
present Prince of Wales! What rational hopes from many
circumstances that beset him. The Royal infant, we are told, is
suckled by a person &ldquo;named Brough, formerly a
<em>housemaid</em> at Esher.&rdquo; From this very fact, will not
the Royal child grow up with the consciousness that he owes his
nourishment even to the very humblest of the people? Will he not
suck in the humanising truth with his very milk?</p>
<p>And then for the Spanish treasure&mdash;&ldquo;hard food for
Midas&rdquo;&mdash;that threw its jaundiced glory about the cradle
of George the Fourth; what is that to the promise of plenty,
augured by the natal day of our present Prince? Comes he not on the
ninth of November? Is not his advent glorified by the aromatic
clouds of the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s kitchen?&mdash;Let every man,
woman, and child possess themselves of a <em>Times</em> newspaper
of the 10th ult.; for there, in genial companionship with the
chronicle of the birth of the Prince, is the luscious history of
the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s dinner. We quit Buckingham Palace, our mind
full of our dear little Queen, the Royal baby, Prince
Albert&mdash;(who, as <em>The Standard</em> informs us
subsequently, bows &ldquo;bare-headed&rdquo; to the
populace,)&mdash;the Archbishop of Canterbury, Doctor Locock, the
Duke of Wellington, and the monthly nurse, and immediately fall
upon the civic &ldquo;general bill of fare,&rdquo;&mdash;the real
turtle at the City board.</p>
<p>Oh, men of Paisley&mdash;good folks of Bolton&mdash;what promise
for ye is here! Turkeys, capons, sirloins, asparagus, pheasants,
pine-apples, Savoy cakes, Chantilly baskets, mince pies, preserved
ginger, brandy cherries, a thousand luscious cakes that &ldquo;the
sense aches at!&rdquo; What are all these gifts of plenty, but a
glad promise that in the time of the &ldquo;sweetest young
Prince,&rdquo; that on the birth-day of that Prince just vouchsafed
to us, all England will be a large Lord Mayor&rsquo;s table! Will
it be possible for Englishmen to dissassociate in their minds the
Prince of Wales and the Prince of good Fellows? And whereas the
reigns of other potentates are signalised by bloodshed and war, the
time of the Prince will be glorified by cooking and good cheer. His
drum-sticks will be the drum-sticks of turkeys&mdash;his cannon,
the popping of corks. In his day, even weavers shall know the taste
of geese, and factory-children smack their lips at the gravy of the
great sirloin. Join your glasses! brandish your carving-knives! cry
welcome to the Prince of Wales! for he comes garnished with all the
world&rsquo;s good things. He shall live in the hearts, and (what
is more) in the stomachs of his people!</p>

<h3>PROPER PRECAUTION.</h3>
<p>Everybody is talking of the great impropriety that has been
practised in keeping gunpowder within the Tower; and the papers are
<em>blowing up</em> the authorities with astounding violence for
their alleged laxity. &ldquo;Gunpowder,&rdquo; say the angry
journalists, &ldquo;ought only to be kept where there is no
possibility of a spark getting to it.&rdquo;&mdash;We suggest the
bottom of the Thames, as the only place where, in future, this
precious preparation can be securely deposited.</p>

<h2>THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE LONDON MEDICAL STUDENT.</h2>
<h3>8.&mdash;OF THE EXAMINATION AT APOTHECARIES&rsquo; HALL.</h3>
<div class="dropcap"><a href="images/019-08.png"><img src=
"images/019-08.png" alt=
"Two Chinese men face each other with their queues standing out to form a letter T."
id="img019-08" name="img019-08" width="100%" /></a></div>
<p><span class="hidden">T</span>he last task that devolves upon our
student before he goes up to the Hall is to hunt up his
testimonials of attendance to lectures and good moral conduct in
his apprenticeship, together with his parochial certificate of age
and baptism. The first of these is the chief point to obtain; the
two last he generally writes himself, in the style best consonant
with his own feelings and the date of his indenture. His
&ldquo;morality ticket&rdquo; is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="cen">(Copy.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hereby certify, that during the period Mr. Joseph Muff
served his time with me he especially recommended himself to my
notice by his studious and attentive habits, highly moral and
gentlemanly conduct, and excellent disposition. He always availed
himself of every opportunity to improve his professional
knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="cen">(Signed)</p>
<p class="rgt">According to the name on the indenture.</p>
<p>The certificate of attendance upon lectures is only obtained in
its most approved state by much clever manoeuvring. It is important
to bear in mind that a lecturer should never be asked whilst he is
loitering about the school for his signature of the student&rsquo;s
diligence. He may then have time to recollect his ignorance of his
pupil&rsquo;s face at his discourses. He should always be caught
flying&mdash;either immediately before or after his
lecture&mdash;in order that the whole business may be too hurried
to admit of investigation. In the space left for the degree of
attention which the student has shown, it is better that he
subscribes nothing at all than an indifferent report; because, in
the former case, the student can fill it up to his own
satisfaction. He usually prefers the phrase&mdash;&ldquo;with
unremitting diligence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And having arrived at this important section of our Physiology,
it behoves us to publish, for the benefit of medical students in
general, and those about to go up in particular, the following</p>
<h4>CODE OF INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
<h5>TO BE OBSERVED BY THOSE PREPARING FOR EXAMINATION AT THE
HALL.</h5>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Previously to going up, take some pills and get your hair cut.
This not only clears your faculties, but improves your appearance.
The Court of Examiners dislike long hair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not drink too much stout before you go in, with the idea that
it will give you pluck. It renders you very valiant for half an
hour and then muddles your notions with indescribable
confusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having arrived at the Hall, put your rings and chains in your
pocket, and, if practicable, publish a pair of spectacles. This
will endow you with a grave look.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On taking your place at the table, if you wish to gain time,
feign to be intensely frightened. One of the examiners will then
rise to give you a tumbler of water, which you may, with good
effect, rattle tremulously against your teeth when drinking. This
may possibly lead them to excuse bad answers on the score of
extreme nervous trepidation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should things appear to be going against you, get up a hectic
cough, which is easily imitated, and look acutely miserable, which
you will probably do without trying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Endeavour to assume an off-hand manner of answering; and when
you have stated any pathological fact&mdash;right or
wrong&mdash;<em>stick to it</em>; if they want a case for example,
invent one, &ldquo;that happened when you were an apprentice in the
country.&rdquo; This assumed confidence will sometimes bother them.
We knew a student who once swore at the Hall, that he gave opium in
a case of concussion of the brain, and that the patient never
required anything else. It was true&mdash;he never did.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should you be fortunate enough to pass, go to your hospital next
day and report your examination, describing it as the most
extraordinary ordeal of deep-searching questions ever undergone.
This will make the professors think well of you, and the new men
deem yon little less than a mental Colossus. Say, also, &ldquo;you
were complimented by the Court.&rdquo; This advice is, however,
scarcely necessary, as we never know a student pass who was not
thus honoured&mdash;according to his own account.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr class="short" />
<p>All things being arranged to his satisfaction, he deposits his
papers under the care of Mr. Sayer, and passes the interval before
the fatal day much in the same state of mind as a condemned
criminal. At last Thursday arrives, and at a quarter to four, any
person who takes the trouble to station himself at the corner of
Union-street will see various groups of three and four young men
wending their way towards the portals of Apothecaries&rsquo; Hall,
consisting of students about to be examined, accompanied by friends
who come down with them to keep up their spirits. They approach the
door, and shake hands as they give and receive wishes of success.
The wicket closes on the candidates, and their friends adjourn to
the &ldquo;Retail Establishment&rdquo; opposite, to <em>go the odd
man</em> and pledge their anxious companions in dissector&rsquo;s
diet-drink&mdash;<em>vulgo</em>, half-and-half.</p>
<p>Leaving them to their libations, we follow our old friend Mr.
Joseph Muff. He crosses the paved court-yard with the air of a man
who had lost half-a-crown and found a halfpenny; and through the
windows sees the assistants dispensing plums, pepper, and
prescriptions, with provoking indifference. Turning to the left, he
ascends a solemn-looking staircase, adorned with severe black
figures in niches, who support lamps. On the top of the staircase
he enters a room, wherein the partners of his misery are collected.
It is a long narrow apartment, commonly known as &ldquo;the
funking-room,&rdquo; ornamented with a savage-looking fireplace at
one end, and a huge surly chest at the other; with gloomy presses
against the walls, containing dry mouldy books in harsh, repulsive
bindings. The windows look into the court; and the glass is scored
by diamond rings, and the shutters pencilled with names and
sentences, which Mr. Muff regards with feelings similar to those he
would experience in contemplating the inscriptions on the walls of
a condemned cell. The very chairs in the room look overbearing and
unpleasant; and the whole locality is invested with an
overallishness of unanswerable questions and intricate botheration.
Some of the students are marching up and down the room in feverish
restlessness; others, arm in arm, are worrying each other to death
with questions; and the rest are grinding away to the last minute
at a manual, or trying to write minute atomic numbers on their
thumb-nail.</p>
<p>The clock strikes five, and Mr. Sayer enters the room,
exclaiming&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Manhug, Mr. Jones, Mr. Saxby, and Mr.
Collins.&rdquo; The four depart to the chamber of examination,
where the medical inquisition awaits them, with every species of
mental torture to screw their brains instead of their thumbs, and
rack their intellects instead of their limbs,&mdash;the chair on
which the unfortunate student is placed being far more uneasy than
the tightest fitting &ldquo;Scavenger&rsquo;s daughter&rdquo; in
the Tower of London. After an anxious hour, Mr. Jones returns, with
a light bounding step to a joyous extempore air of his own
composing: he has passed. In another twenty minutes Mr. Saxby walks
fiercely in, calls for his hat, condemns the examiners <em>ad
inferos</em>, swears he shall cut the profession, and marches away.
He has been plucked; and Mr. Muff, who stands sixth on the list, is
called on to make his appearance before the awful tribunal.</p>
<hr />
<h3>REGULARLY CALLED IN&mdash;AND BOWLED OUT.</h3>
<p>Dr. Demosthenes &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Bedford, who has
lately broken out in a new place, has been accused by the lieges of
the Borough of having acted in a most unprofessional manner; in
short, with having lost his <em>patience</em>. He, Dr. Demosthenes
&amp;c. begs to state, the only surgical operation he ever
attempted was most successful, notwithstanding it was the difficult
one of amputating his &ldquo;mahogany;&rdquo; and he further adds,
the only case he ever had is still in his hand, it being a most
obstinate</p>

<h2>THE PRINCE OF WALES.</h2>
<p class="cen">(<em>By the Observer&rsquo;s Own
Correspondent.</em>)</p>
<p>Knowing the anxiety that will be felt on this subject, though we
doubt if the future King can be called <em>a subject</em> at all,
we have collected the following exclusive particulars:&mdash;</p>
<h3>THE PRINCE&rsquo;S TITLE.</h3>
<p>His Royal Highness will for the present go by the title of
&ldquo;Poppet,&rdquo; affectionately conferred upon him by Mrs.
Lilly at the moment of his birth. Poppet is a title of very great
antiquity, and has from time immemorial been used as a mark of
endearment towards a newly-born child in all genteel families.
Lovey-Dovey has been spoken of; but it is not likely that His Royal
Highness will assume the style and dignity of Lovey-Dovey for a
considerable period.</p>
<h3>THE PRINCE&rsquo;S INCOME.</h3>
<p>Considerable mistakes have been fallen into by some of our
contemporaries on this important subject. What may be the present
wishes of His Royal Highness it is impossible for any one to
ascertain, for he is able to articulate nothing on this point with
his little pipe; but the piper, we know, must be eventually paid.
He becomes immediately entitled to all the loose halfpence in his
mother&rsquo;s reticule, and sixpence a-week will be at once
payable out of his father&rsquo;s estates at Saxe Gotha. The whole
of the revenues attached to the Duchy of Cornwall are also his by
the mere fact of his birth: but there is a difficulty as to his
giving a receipt for the money, if it should be paid to him. It is
believed, that on the meeting of Parliament a Bill will pass for
granting peg-top money to His Royal Highness, and a lollipop
allowance will be among the earliest estimates.</p>
<h3>THE PRINCE&rsquo;S MILITARY RANK.</h3>
<p>The Prince of Wales is by birth at the head of all the
<em>Infantry</em> in the kingdom, and is Colonel in his own right
of a regiment of tin soldiers.</p>
<h3>THE PRINCE&rsquo;S WARDROBE.</h3>
<p>The Prince falls at once into all the long frocks that are
required, and has an estate tail in six dozen napkins.</p>
<h3>THE PRINCE&rsquo;S EDUCATION.</h3>
<p>This important matter will be confined at present to teaching
His Royal Highness how to take his pap without spilling it. A
professor from the pap-al states will, it is expected, be entrusted
with this branch of the royal economy.</p>
<h3>THE PRINCE&rsquo;S WET-NURSE.</h3>
<p>Our contemporaries are wrong in stating that the individual to
whom the post of wet-nurse has been assigned is nothing but a
housemaid. We have full authority to state that she is no maid at
all, but a respectable married woman.</p>
<h3>THE PRINCE&rsquo;S HONOURS.</h3>
<p>His Royal Highness has not yet been created a Knight of the
Garter, though Sir James Clark insisted on his being admitted to
the Bath, against which ceremony the infant Prince entered a
vociferous protest.</p>
<p>The whole of the above particulars may be relied on as having
been furnished from the very highest authority.</p>
<hr />
<h3>A BARROWKNIGHT.</h3>
<p>SIR WILLOUGHBY COTTON, during his visit to the Mansion-House
Feast, in a moment of forgetfulness after the song of &ldquo;Hurrah
for the Road,&rdquo; being asked to take wine with the new Lord
Mayor, declined the honour in the genuine long-stage phraseology,
declaring he had already whacked his fare, and was quite</p>

<p>FULL INSIDE.</p>
</div>
<hr />
<h3>MAGISTERIAL AXIOMS.</h3>
<h4>VIDE POLICE REPORTS.</h4>
<p>An Irishman will <em>swear anything</em>.&mdash;<em>Mr.
Grove</em>.</p>
<p>A man who wears long hair is <em>capable of
anything</em>.&mdash;<em>Sir Peter Laurie</em>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>THE ROYAL BULLETINS.</h3>
<p>The documents lately shown at Buckingham Palace are spurious,
and the real ones have been suppressed from party motives, which we
shall not allude to. The following are genuine; they relate only to
the Prince, the convalescence of Her Majesty being, we are glad to
say, so rapid as to require no official notice.</p>
<p class="rgt"><em>Half-past Twelve</em>.</p>
<p>The Prince has sneezed, and it is believed has smiled, though
the nurses are unable to pronounce whether the expression of
pleasure arose from satisfaction or cholic.</p>
<p class="rgt"><em>Quarter past One</em>.</p>
<p>The Prince has passed a comfortable minute, and is much
easier.</p>
<p class="rgt"><em>Two O&rsquo;Clock</em>.</p>
<p>The Prince is fast asleep, and is more quiet.</p>
<p class="rgt"><em>Half-past Two</em>.</p>
<p>The Prince has been shown to Sir Robert Peel, and was very
fretful.</p>
<p class="rgt"><em>Three O&rsquo;Clock</em>.</p>
<p>Sir Robert Peel has left the Palace, and the Prince is again
perfectly composed.</p>
<hr />
<h3>DEVILLED DRUMSTICKS.</h3>
<p>Our own Sir Peter Laurie, upon witnessing the extraordinary
performance of little Wieland in <em>Die Hexen am Rhein</em>, at
the Adelphi Theatre, was so transported with his diabolic agility,
that he determined upon endeavouring to arrive at the same
perfection of pliability. As a guide for his undertaking, he
instantly despatched old Hobler for a folio edition of</p>

name="img019-11" width="30%" /></a>
<p>IMPEY&rsquo;S PRACTICE.</p>
</div>
<hr />
<h3>BRANDY AND WATERFORD. (A GO!)</h3>
<p>The Marquis of Waterford, upon his recent visit to Devonshire,
was much struck with the peculiar notice upon the County
Stretchers. Being overtaken by some of their extra-bottled
apple-juice, he tested the truth of the statement, and found them
literally &ldquo;licensed to carry <em>one in cyder</em>&rdquo;
(<em>one insider</em>).</p>
<hr />
<h3>THE WHEELS OF FORTUNE.</h3>
<p>SIR WYNDHAM ANSTRUTHER, whose &ldquo;Young Rapid&rdquo;
connexion with the <em>Stage</em> is pretty generally known, boasts
that his stud was unrivalled for speed, as he managed with his four
to &ldquo;run through&rdquo; his whole estates in six months, which
he thinks a pretty decent proof that his might well be
considered</p>

<hr />
<h3>SEEING NOTHING</h3>
<p>COMMISSIONER HARVEY and his old crony, Joe Hume, were talking
lately of the wonders which the latter had seen in his
travels&mdash;&ldquo;You have been on Mont Blanc,&rdquo; said
Whittle. &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;And
what did you see there?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why really,&rdquo; said Joe,
&ldquo;it is always so wrapped up in a double-milled fog, that
there is nothing to be seen from it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo;
echoed he of the Blues; &ldquo;I never knew till now why it was
called Mount <em>Blank</em>.&rdquo; As this was the
Commissioner&rsquo;s first attempt at a witticism, we forgive
him.</p>
<hr />
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page227" name="page227"></a>[pg

<h3>MORE FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE.</h3>
<p class="cen">(FROM OUR OWN ONE.)</p>
<p>A marriage is on the <em>tapis</em> between Mr. John Smith, the
distinguished toll-collector at the Marsh Gate, and Miss Julia
Belinda Snooks, the lovely and accomplished daughter of the gallant
out-pensioner of Greenwich Hospital. Should the wedding take place,
the bridegroom will be given away by Mr. Levy, the great
toll-contractor; while the blushing bride will be attended to the
altar by her mother-in-law, the well-known laundress of
Tash-street. The <em>trousseau</em>, consisting of a selection from
a bankrupt&rsquo;s stock of damaged <em>de laines</em>, has been
purchased at Lambeth House; and a parasol carefully chosen from a
lot of 500, all at one-and-ninepence, will be presented by the
happy bridegroom on the morning of the marriage. A cabman has
already been spoken to, and a shilling fare has been sketched out
for the eventful morning, which is so arranged as to terminate at
the toll-house, from which Mr. Smith can only be absent for about
an hour, during which time the toll will be taken by an amateur of
celebrity.</p>
<p>Among the fashionables at the Bower Saloon, we observed Messrs.
Jones and Brown, Mr. J. Jones, Mr. H. Jones, Mr. M. Brown, Mr. K.
Brown, and several other distinguished leaders of the <em>ton</em>

<p>There is no truth in the report that Tom Timkins intends
resigning his seat at the apple-stall in the New Cut; and the
rumours of a successor are therefore premature and indelicate.</p>

<h3>CONS. WORTH CONNING.</h3>
<p>Why is the making a <em>mem.</em> of the number of a
person&rsquo;s residence like a general election?&mdash;Because
it&rsquo;s done to re-member <em>the house</em>.</p>
<p>Why is Count D&rsquo;Orsay a capital piece of furniture for a

<h3>MORBID SYMPATHY FOR CRIMINALS.</h3>
<p>Our contemporary, the <em>Times</em>, for the last few days has
been very justly deprecating the existing morbid sympathy for
criminals. The moment that a man sins against the conventionalities
of society he ought certainly to be excluded from all claims upon
the sympathy of his fellows. It is very true that even the felon
has kindred, parents, wife, children&mdash;for whom, and in whom,
God has implanted an instinctive love. It is true that the criminal
may have been led by the example of aristocratic sinners to
disregard the injunctions of revealed religion against the
adulterer, the gamester, and the drunkard; and having imitated the
&ldquo;pleasant follies&rdquo; of the great without possessing the
requisite means for such enjoyments, the man of pleasure has
degenerated into the man of crime. It is true that the poor and
ignorant may have claims upon the wealth and the intelligence of
the rich and learned; but are we to pause to inquire whether want
may have driven the destitute to theft, or the absence of early
instruction have left the physical desires of the offender&rsquo;s
nature superior to its moral restrictions.&mdash;Certainly not,
whilst we have a gallows. There is, however, one difficulty which
seems to interfere with a liberal exercise of the rope and the
beam. Where are we to find executioners? for if &ldquo;whoso
sheddeth man&rsquo;s blood&rdquo; be amenable to man, surely Jack
Ketch is not to be exempted.</p>
<p>The <em>Times</em> condemns the late Lord Chamberlain for
allowing the representation of &ldquo;Jack Sheppard&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Madame Laffarge&rdquo; at the Adelphi; so do we. The
<em>Times</em> intimates, that &ldquo;the newspapers teem with
details about everything which such criminals &lsquo;as Dick Turpin
and Jack Sheppard&rsquo; say or do; that complete biographies of
them are presented to the public; that report after report
expatiates upon every refinement and peculiarity in their
wickedness,&rdquo; for &ldquo;the good purpose&rdquo; of warning
the embryo highwayman. We are something more than <em>duberous</em>
of this. We can see no difference between the exhibition of the
stage and the gloating of the broadsheet; they are both &ldquo;the
agents by which the exploits of the gay highwayman are realised
before his eyes, amid a brilliant and evidently sympathising&rdquo;
public. We deprecate both, as tending to excite the weak-minded to
gratify &ldquo;the ambition of this kind of
notoriety;&rdquo;&mdash;and yet we say, with the <em>Times</em>,
there should be &ldquo;no sympathy for criminals.&rdquo;</p>
<hr />
<h3>THE MALE DALILAH.</h3>
<p>Sir Peter Laurie&rsquo;s aversion to long locks is accounted for
by his change of political opinions, he having some time since

<h2>A &ldquo;PUNCH&rdquo; TESTIMONIAL.</h2>
<p>We are virtuously happy to announce that a meeting has been held
at the <em>Hum</em>-mums Hotel, Colonel Sibthorp in the chair, for
the purpose of presenting to PUNCH some testimonial of public
esteem for his exertions in the detection and exposure of
fraudulent wits and would-be distinguished characters.</p>
<p>COLONEL SIBTHORP thanked the meeting for the honour they had
conferred upon him in electing him their chairman upon this
occasion. None knew better than himself the service that PUNCH had
rendered to the public. But for that fun fed individual his (Col.
Sibthorp&rsquo;s) own brilliant effusions would have been left to
have smouldered in his brain, or have hung like cobwebs about the
House of Commons. (<em>Hear, hear</em>!) But PUNCH had stepped in
to the rescue; he had not only preserved some of the brilliant
things that he (Col. Sibthorp) had said, but had also reported many
of the extremely original witticisms that he had intended to have
uttered. (<em>Hear</em>!) There were many honourable
gentlemen&mdash;(he begged pardon&mdash;gentlemen, he meant,
without the honourable; but he had been so long a member of
parliament that he had acquired a habit of calling men and things
out of their proper names). Apologising for so lengthy a
parenthesis, he would say that there were many gentlemen who were
equally indebted (<em>hear! from Sir Peter Laurie, Peter Borthwick,
and Pre-Adam Roebuck</em>) to this jocular benefactor. &ldquo;It
was PUNCH,&rdquo; said the gallant gentleman, with much feeling,
&ldquo;who first convinced me that the popular opinion of my
asinine capabilities was erroneous. It was PUNCH who discovered
that there was as much in my head as on it(<em>loud cheers,
produced doubtlessly by the aptness of the simile, the gallant
Colonel being perfectly bald</em>). I should, therefore, be the
most ungrateful of Members for Lincoln, did I not entreat of this
meeting to mark their high sense of Mr. PUNCH&rsquo;S exertions by
a liberal subscription&rdquo; (<em>cheers</em>).</p>
<p>SIR PETER LAURIE acknowledged himself equally in debt with their
gallant Chairman to the object of the present meeting. He (Sir
Peter) had tried all schemes to obtain popularity&mdash;he had made
speeches without number or meaning&mdash;he had done double duty at
the Mansion-house, and had made Mr. Hobler laugh more heartily than
any Lord Mayor or Alderman since the days of Whittington (during
whose mayoralty the venerable Chief Clerk first took
office)&mdash;he (Sir P. Laurie) had, after much difficulty and
four years&rsquo; practice, received the Queen on horseback
(<em>much cheering</em>); but (<em>continued
cheering</em>)&mdash;but it was left for PUNCH to achieve his
immortality (<em>immense cheering&mdash;several squares of glass in
the conservatory opposite broken by the explosion</em>). He (Sir P.
Laurie) had done all in his power to deserve the notice of that
illustrious wooden individual. He had endeavoured to be much more
ass&mdash;(<em>loud cheers</em>)&mdash;iduous than ever. PUNCH had
rewarded him; and he therefore felt it his bounden duty to reward
PUNCH. (<em>Hear! hear!</em>)</p>
<p>MR. ROEBUCK fully concurred in the preceding eulogies. What had
not PUNCH done for him? Had not PUNCH extinguished the
<em>Times</em> by the honest way in which he had advocated his
(Roebuck&rsquo;s) injured genealogy? Had PUNCH not proved that he
(Mr. Roebuck) had a father, which the &ldquo;mendacious
journal&rdquo; had asserted was impossible? Had not PUNCH traced
the Roebuck family as far back as 1801?&mdash;that was something!
But he (Mr. Roebuck) believed that he had been injured by an error
of the press, and that PUNCH had written the numerals 1081. Be that
as it might, he (Mr. Roebuck) was anxious to discharge the
overwhelming debt of gratitude which he owed to MR. PUNCH, and
intended to subscribe very largely (<em>cheers</em>).</p>
<p>MR. PETER BORTHWICK had been in former years a Shaksperian
actor. He had for many seasons, at the &ldquo;Royal Rugby
Barn,&rdquo; had the honour of bearing the principal banners in all
the imposing processions, &ldquo;got up at an immense
expense&rdquo; in that unique establishment. (<em>Hear</em>!) He
was, therefore, better qualified than any gentleman present to form
an opinion of the services which Punch had rendered to the British
Drama (<em>loud and continued cheers, during which Mr. Yates rushed
on to the platform, and bowed several times to the assembled
multitude</em>). Therefore, as a devoted admirer of that art which
he (Peter) trusted HE and Shakspere had adorned (<em>cheers</em>),
he fondly hoped that the meeting would at once take tickets, when
he announced that the performance was for the benefit of Mr.
PUNCH.</p>
<p>LORD MORPETH next presented himself; but our reporter, having
promised to take tea with his grandmother, left before the Noble
Lord opened his mouth.</p>
<p>We hope next week to furnish the remainder of the speeches, and
a very long list of subscriptions.</p>

<h2>THE RAPE OF THE LOCK-UP;</h2>
<h3>OR, SIR PETER LAURIE ON CRIME AND THE CROPS.</h3>
<p>We believe no longing was ever more firmly planted in the human
heart, than that of discovering some short cut to the high road of
mental acquirement. The toilsome learner&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Progress&rdquo; through the barren outset of the alphabet;
the slough of despond of seven syllables, endangered as they both
are by the frequent appearance of the compulsive birch of the Mr.
Worldly-wisemen who teach the young idea how to shoot, must ever be
looked upon as a probation, the power of avoiding which is &ldquo;a
consummation devoutly to be wished.&rdquo; Imbued with this
feeling, the more speculative of past ages have frequently
attempted to arrive, by external means, at the immediate possession
of results otherwise requiring a long course of intense study and
anxious inquiry. From these defunct illuminati originated the
suppositionary virtues of the magically-endowed divining wand. The
simple bending of a forked hazel twig, being the received sign of
the deep-buried well, suited admirably with their notions of
immediate information, and precluded the unpleasant and toilsome
necessity for delving on speculation for the discovery of their
desired object. But, alas, divining rods, like dogs, have had their
day. The want of faith in the operators, or the growth of a new and
obstinate assortment of hazel twigs, threw discredit on the mummery
and the mummers. Still the passion existed; and in no case was it
more observable than in that of the celebrated witch-finder. An
actual presence at the demoniacal rites of the broom-riding
sisterhood would have been attended with much danger and
considerable difficulty; indeed, it has been asserted that the
visitors, like those at Almack&rsquo;s, were expected to be
balloted for, ticketed, and dressed in a manner suiting the
occasion. Any infringement of these rules must have been at the
proper peril of the contumacious infringer; and as it is more than
probable some of the brooms carried double, there was a very decent
chance of the intruder&rsquo;s discovering himself across one of
the heavy-tailed and strong-backed breed, taking a trip to some
distant bourne, from whence that compulsory aerial traveller would
doubtless never have returned. Still witches were evils; and proof
of evil is what the law seeks to enable evil&rsquo;s suppression.
Now and again one of these short-cut gentry, by some railroad
system of mental calculation, discovered certain external marks or
moles that at a glance betrayed &ldquo;the secret, dark, and
midnight hags;&rdquo; and the witch-finding process was
instantaneously established. The outward and visible sign of their
misdeeds authorised the further proceeding necessary for the clear
proof of their delinquencies: thus the pinchings, beatings,
starvings, trials, hangings, and burnings were made the goal of the
shortest of all imaginable short cuts; and old women who had
established pin manufactories in the stomachs of thousands, instead
of receiving patents for their inventions, divided the honour of
illuminating the land with the blazing tar-barrels provided for
their peculiar use and benefit. Whether it was that aerial gambols
on unsaddled and rough-backed broomsticks grew tiresome, or the
small profit attending the vocation became smaller, or that all the
elderly ladies with moles, and without anything else, were burnt
up, we can&rsquo;t pretend to say; but certain it is, the art of
witchcraft fell into disrepute. Corking, minikin, and all
description of pins, were obliged to be made in the regular way;
and cows even departed this world without the honour of the human
immolations formerly considered the necessary sacrifice for the
loss of their inestimable lives. Since the abovetimes Animal
Magnetism and Mesmerism have followed in the wake of what has been;
and now, just as despair, already poised upon its outstretched
sable wings, was hovering for a brief moment previous to making its
final swoop upon the External Doctrine, Peter&mdash;our
Peter&mdash;Peter Laurie&mdash;the great, the glorious, the
aldermanic Laurie&mdash;makes despair, like the Indian Juggler who
swallowed himself, become the victim of its own insatiate maw.</p>
<p>Our quill trembles as we proceed; it is unequal to the task. Oh,
that we could write with the whole goose upon the wondrous merits
of the wondrous Peter!</p>
<p>We are better. That bumper has restored our nerve.</p>
<p>Reader, fancy the gifted Peter seated in the dull dignity of
civic magistracy: the court is thronged&mdash;a young delinquent
blinks like an owl in sunshine &rsquo;neath the mighty flashing of
his bench-lit eye. His crime, ay, what&rsquo;s his crime? it
can&rsquo;t be much&mdash;so pale, so thin, so woe-begone! look,
too, so tremulous of knee, and redolent of hair! what has he
done?</p>
<p>Here Roe interprets&mdash;&ldquo;Please your worship, this young
man, or tailor, has been assaulting several females with a blue bag
and a pair of breeches.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Sir Peter</em>.&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at it;
that man would do anything, I see it in his face, or rather in the
back of his head, that&rsquo;s where the expression lies&mdash;look
at his hair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole court becomes a Cyclops&mdash;it has but one eye, and
that is fixed upon the tailor&rsquo;s locks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; resumes our Peter, &ldquo;a man with that
head of hair would do anything&mdash;pray, sir, do you wish to be
taken for a German sausage, or a German
student?&mdash;they&rsquo;re all the same, sir&mdash;speak at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The faltering fraction denies the student, and repudiates the
sausage.</p>
<p><em>Sir Peter</em>, still looking at the hair, from which
external sign he evidently derived all his
information&mdash;&ldquo;You were drunk, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; faltered the Samsonian schneider.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, sir&mdash;you are fined five shillings,
sir&mdash;but if you choose to submit to the deprivation of that
iniquitous hair, which has brought you here, and which, I repeat,
will make you do anything, I will remit the fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sigh, fine-drawn as the accidental rent in an unfinished
skirt, escaped the hirsute stitcher: a melancholy reflection upon
the infinite deal of nothing in his various pockets, and the slow
revolving of the Brixton wheel in stern perspective, wrung from the
quodded wretch a slow assent: Sir Peter sent a City officer with
his warrant to secure the nearest barber: a few sharp clickings of
the envious shears&mdash;and all was over! Crime fell from the
shoulders of the quondam culprit, and the tonsorial innocent stood
forth confessed!</p>
<p>Sir Peter was entranced. That was his doing! He gazed with pride
upon the new absolved from sin. He asked, &ldquo;Are you not more
comfortable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All vice had gone, save one&mdash;the young man answered
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and <em>lied</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, sir, go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The barber,&rdquo; muttered &ldquo;soft Roe&rdquo; in as
soft a voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wants a shillin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is,&rdquo; exclaimed the Augustine Peter,
&ldquo;there, from my own pocket, paid with pleasure to preserve
that youth from the evil influence of too much
hair&mdash;I&rsquo;ll pay for all the City if they like&mdash;and
banished suicide, and I&rsquo;ll pretty soon see if I can&rsquo;t
settle all the City crops. Prisoner, you are discharged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man lost his hair, the Queen five shillings, and Sir
Peter one; but then he gained his end,&mdash;and docking must
henceforth be looked upon as the treadmill&rsquo;s antidote, and
young man&rsquo;s fines&rsquo; best friend. We therefore say,
should the iniquity of your long locks, gentle reader, take you to
the station (for, remember, Sir Peter says, <em>Long hair will do
anything</em>), if you can&rsquo;t find bail, secure a barber, and
command your liberation. We have been speculating of these
externally-illustrated grades of crime; we think the following
nearly correct:&mdash;</p>
<p>The long and lank indicates larceny (petty and otherwise).</p>
<p>The bushy and bountiful&mdash;burglary.</p>
<p>The full and flowing&mdash;felony.</p>
<p>The magnificent and mysterious&mdash;murder.</p>
<p>And, for aught we know, pigtails&mdash;polygamy.</p>
<p>For the future, a thinking man&rsquo;s motto will be, not to
mind &ldquo;his own eye,&rdquo; but everybody else&rsquo;s
hair.</p>
<p>P.S. We have just received the following horrifying
communication which establishes Sir Peter&rsquo;s opinion,
&ldquo;that a man with such hair would do anything,&rdquo; but
unfortunately disproves the remedy, as those atrocities have been
committed when he was without.</p>
<p>Indignant at the loss of his head&rsquo;s glory, the evil-minded
tailor, immediately upon leaving the court, sent for
counsel&rsquo;s opinion as to whether he couldn&rsquo;t proceed
against Sir Peter, under the act for &ldquo;cutting and maiming,
with intent to do him some grievous bodily harm.&rdquo; This, it
appears he cannot do, inasmuch as these very learned gentlemen at
the bar have decided, &ldquo;the head&rdquo; from which the hair
was cut, and which, if any, is consequently the injured part, is
not included in the meaning of the word <em>bodily</em>, as &amp;c.
&amp;c. Foiled in this attempt, the monster, for the brutal
gratification of his burning revenge, hit upon a scheme the most
diabolical that human hair could conceive. He actually applied to
the Society for the Suppression of <em>Cruelty to Animals</em>; and
they, upon inspecting a portion of the dissevered locks,
immediately took up the case, and are about to indict Sir Peter,
Roe, and the barber, under one of the clauses of that tremendous
act. If they proceed for penalties in individual cases, they must
be immense, as the killed and wounded are beyond
calculation,&mdash;not to mention all that the process has left
homeless, foodless, and destitute.</p>
<hr />
<h3>BARBER-OUS ANNOUNCEMENT.</h3>
<p>We beg to inform our readers that Mr. Tanner, of Temple-bar and
Shire-lane, whose salon extends from the city of London to the
liberties of Westminster, has this day been appointed Hair-cutter
Extraordinary to Sir Peter Laurie.</p>
<hr />
<h3>A NEW MILKY WAY.</h3>
<p>KIRCHOFF, a Prussian chemist, is reported to have discovered a
process by which milk may be preserved for an indefinite period.
Fresh milk is evaporated by a very gentle heat till it is reduced
to a dry powder, which is to be kept perfectly dry in a bottle.
When required for use it need only be diluted with a sufficient
quantity of water. Mr. James Jones, who keeps a red cow&mdash;over
his door&mdash;claims the original idea of making milk from a white
powder, which, he states, may be done without the tedious process
of evaporation, by using an article entirely known to London
milk-vendors&mdash;namely <em>chalk</em>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>OH GEMINI!</h3>
<p>At the close of the Civic Festival last week, Sir William
Follett inquired of the Recorder if he had seen his
<em>Castor</em>. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Law (holding up the
Attorney-General&rsquo;s fifty-seven penn&rsquo;orth), &ldquo;but
here is your brother Pollock&rsquo;s&rdquo; (<em>Pollux</em>.)</p>
<hr />
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sir Peter Hobler the other morning,
&ldquo;I should think you will be denied the <em>entr&eacute;e</em>
to the Palace after your decision of Saturday.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why
so?&rdquo; inquired the knight of leather. &ldquo;For fear you
should cut off the heir to the Throne!&rdquo; screamed Hobler, and
vanished.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
